## Access Keys

### What are they?

The accesskey HTML attribute allows web developer to assign keyboard shortcuts to web elements. This sounds like a great idea but in reality the developers of both browsers and assistive technologies have previously implemented inconsistent and ineffective support for the feature.

### Should we use access keys ?

Whilst it can like a minefield trying to implement access keys that are both useful and don't disadvantage users of assistive technologies that are at risk of clashing with them doens't mean it's impossible. In fact, when well thought out access keys can be a handy tool for some users of your website/application and save a lot of time and effort especially when repetitive tasks are involved.
